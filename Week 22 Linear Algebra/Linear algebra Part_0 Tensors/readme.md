# 📦 Tensors in Machine Learning

## 🧠 What is a Tensor?

A **tensor** is a multi-dimensional array used to store data in machine learning and deep learning.

| Type          | Example                      | Shape       |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Scalar        | `5`                          | ()          |
| Vector        | `[1, 2, 3]`                  | (3,)        |
| Matrix        | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`           | (2, 2)      |
| Tensor (3D+)  | `[[[...], [...]], [[...]]]`  | (2, 2, 2)   |

## ⚙️ Why are Tensors Important?

- ✅ **Standard way to represent data**: images, text, audio → all become tensors.
- ✅ **Efficient computation**: optimized by frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- ✅ **Foundation of Deep Learning**: every neural network input, weight, and output is a tensor.
