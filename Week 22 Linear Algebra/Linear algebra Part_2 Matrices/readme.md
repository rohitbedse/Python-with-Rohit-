# ðŸ§® Matrices in Machine Learning â€“ Part 1

## ðŸ“˜ What is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a 2D array (rows Ã— columns) used to represent structured data.

Example:  
[ [1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6] ] â†’ 2 rows Ã— 3 columns â†’ Shape: (2, 3)

## ðŸ§  Why are Matrices Important in ML?

- âœ… Represent datasets (rows = samples, columns = features)  
- âœ… Core of linear algebra operations like multiplication, inversion, transpose  
- âœ… Used in transformations, image data, and neural network computations
