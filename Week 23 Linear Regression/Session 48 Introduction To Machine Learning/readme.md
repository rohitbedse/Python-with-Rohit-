# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains notes and analysis for the session **"Introduction to Machine Learning"** based on the provided resources:

- ðŸ“º **YouTube Video**: [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/1ctqJCHMAmc?si=nm15ljRHE7h6Zkmp)  
- ðŸ“„ **Supplemental Material (Google Drive)**: [View Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_9GqQjWSWzX4BDXUJK-q4FwuEVuEKtn/view)

The goal of this document is to summarize the main concepts introduced in the session and provide a structured learning reference.

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating systems that can **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

**Key Points:**
- Learns patterns from historical data.
- Improves performance as more data is provided.
- Can handle tasks that are difficult to explicitly code.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Learns from labeled data (input â†’ output mapping).  
   - Examples: Regression, Classification.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Learns patterns from unlabeled data.  
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Learns through trial and error, guided by rewards.  
   - Examples: Game AI, Robotics.

## 3. ML Workflow (as discussed in the session)
1. **Data Collection** â†’ Gather relevant datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â†’ Clean, handle missing values, encode categories.
3. **Model Selection** â†’ Choose an algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
4. **Training** â†’ Fit the model to training data.
5. **Validation** â†’ Tune hyperparameters, prevent overfitting.
6. **Testing** â†’ Evaluate performance on unseen data.
7. **Deployment** â†’ Use the trained model in a real-world application.

## 4. Important Concepts Mentioned
- **Overfitting vs Underfitting**:  
  - Overfitting â†’ Model memorizes training data, fails on new data.  
  - Underfitting â†’ Model too simple, misses patterns.
- **Regularization**: Penalizing large weights to prevent overfitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MSE, RMSE.

---

## 6. How to Use
1. **Watch the YouTube video** to understand the core concepts.
2. **Review the Google Drive material** for detailed explanations and examples.
3. Use these notes as a **foundation** before diving deeper into practical ML projects.

---

## 7. Next Steps for Learners
- Implement a simple supervised learning model (e.g., Linear Regression on a small dataset).
- Experiment with unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means clustering).
- Explore advanced concepts like Feature Engineering, Regularization, and Neural Networks.
