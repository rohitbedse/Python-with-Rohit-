# Session on Differential Calculus

## Overview
This session delves into the foundational concepts of differential calculus, emphasizing its pivotal role in understanding rates of change and its applications in various fields, including machine learning.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Introduction to Differential Calculus
- **Definition**: Differential calculus is a branch of calculus that deals with the study of the rates at which quantities change.
- **Core Idea**: The derivative of a function represents the rate of change of the function's output with respect to its input.

### 2. Fundamental Concepts
- **Limits**: The fundamental concept that underpins the definition of derivatives.
- **Continuity**: Understanding how functions behave without interruption.
- **Derivatives**: The primary tool in differential calculus to measure the rate of change.

### 3. Differentiation Rules
- **Power Rule**: \( \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1} \)
- **Product Rule**: \( \frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv' \)
- **Quotient Rule**: \( \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{v u' - u v'}{v^2} \)
- **Chain Rule**: \( \frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \)

### 4. Applications of Differential Calculus
- **Optimization**: Finding local maxima and minima of functions.
- **Physics**: Describing motion, velocity, and acceleration.
- **Economics**: Analyzing cost functions and marginal analysis.
